# Genetic Algorithm for Laser Pulse Synthesis.


__Layperson Summary__

This project concerns ultra-fast laser pulser. Such pulses are important because they can be used to study matter at the smallest scale, even enabling us to take pictures or individual electrons orbiting atoms.

When people can generate these kind of pulses, a very interesting possibility is to try to combined them to create

__Sientific Summary__

This is a computational project for the optimisation problem of retrieving the 15 parameters required to contructing a 'perfect' wave from 3 distrinct laser pulses
